The year is 50 BFC (Before First Contact). The world is entirely occupied by a few gigantic game engines. Well, not entirely... One small group of indomitable developers still holds out against the invaders.

Let's Kode aims to make it viable again to implement multimedia applications (like for example games) from scratch. We provide the necessary tools, libraries and learning material so you can implement anything you want without giving up control and without worrying about all of todays portability problems.

# Kha and Kore
[Kha](http://kha.tech) and [Kore](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kore) are multimedia frameworks for Haxe and C++ respectively (with JavaScript coming soon). Using Kha or Kore you can access all hardware at the lowest possible level in a completely portable way.

# krafix
[krafix](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/krafix) is a shader cross-compiler. Shader languages for running code on the GPU are platform specific but using krafix you can write your shaders once in GLSL and everything else is taken care of.

# Kode Studio
February 2016...
