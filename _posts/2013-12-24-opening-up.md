2013 was the year of open source for us - open source reached critical mass for the things we care about and we now consider closed source technology generally obsolete. Building on closed source libraries is in the long run a recipe for catastrophe. You can't freely modify the technology, you can't fix bugs, you're always at the mercy of the original developers and most importantly: You can't learn. You're stuck. When you can't dig into the inner workings of the stuff you build you will always stay an amateur - and your products will likely show it.

And so we uploaded Kore and Kha to GitHub. But currently, stuff about it is all over the place - there is a [dedicated website for Kha](http://kha.ktxsoftware.com), Kha's [api docs](http://kha.ktxsoftware.com/api/), a [Kha Google+ group](https://plus.google.com/communities/112730947683696752066), sadly not so much about Kore and of course [our GitHub repositories](https://github.com/KTXSoftware), including some wikis and readmes. In the following weeks we will work to make [tech.ktxsoftware.com](http://tech.ktxsoftware.com) the central hub for all information about our tech - the center of which will be this very blog, providing informations about new features, insights about the design and inner workings of our libraries and - very importantly - we will make an explicit note about each and every code breaking change we push to our repositories.

So what's coming next apart from some website changes? We're reworking our graphical companion tool for Kha and Kore for its open source release which is due at the end of this year (aka ~ this weekend). As a preview here is a little screenshot of our current internal version:
