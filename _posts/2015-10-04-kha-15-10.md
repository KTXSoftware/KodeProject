Kha 15.10 is out now on haxelib.

There was no 15.9, because releases were moved to the beginning of the month, which is a little nicer.
The list for this month is small, but includes two huge features:

* Direct3D 12 support
    * The most complex graphics backend yet. This of course also paves the way for Vulkan support.
* OS X 10.11 support
    * There was a little problem in the GL context initialization.
* Direct AGAL support in krafix
    * No more calls to the old shader compiler.

The old shader compiler will be phased out in the next release - and with it the --nokrafix option. If you are still using the --nokrafix option please report your remaining issues.

Known issues:

* VR and multiplayer support is not yet in a usable state.
* Haxe 3.2 has several problems which can be avoided by using a nightly build or the git version of Kha:
    * It creates slow C++ code due to a constructor inlining bug.
    * The standard library contains a bug that prevents the Java based Android target to work.
    * It is broken on OS X 10.11 because it installs to a location which is now blocked.
