Kha 16.1 is out now on haxelib.

Kha got a big makeover. Samples and tutorials have been updated. Most importantly the concept of rooms was removed, but can easily be reimplemented on top of the new asset subsystem.

Highlights include:

* project.kha is replaced by the much more powerful khafile.js
* Fonts are rasterized at runtime (using a Haxe port of stb_truetype)
* graphics4 was tweaked to run fast on the upcoming graphics5
   * All render state (shaders, blending modes,...) is compiled in a PipelineState
* Convenient cross-platform support for instanced rendering
* Asset handling is much more flexible
   * Handle assets manually and use Assets.loadImageFromPath and Assets.imageFormats
   * Add assets in the khafile and access them using Assets.images.image_name
* Shaders are packed into the executable
   * Access using Shaders.shader_name

Known issues:

* VR support is not yet in a usable state.
* Haxe 3.2 has several problems which can be avoided by using a nightly build or the git version of Kha:
    * It creates slow C++ code due to a constructor inlining bug.
    * The standard library contains a bug that prevents the Java based Android target from working.
